## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gajanan888/StrokeShield-ML.git
cd StrokeShield-ML
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is publicly available stroke prediction dataset (e.g., from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)).

- 👥 **Attributes include:** age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, glucose levels, BMI, smoking status, etc.
- 🎯 **Target:** Stroke (Yes/No)

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The project evaluates models based on:

- ✅ Accuracy
- 🎯 Precision
- 🔄 Recall
- 📊 F1 Score
- 📉 ROC-AUC Curve

---

## 🧪 Example Usage

```python
from src.model import predict_stroke

sample_data = {
    'age': 55,
    'hypertension': 1,
    'heart_disease': 0,
    'avg_glucose_level': 105.5,
    'bmi': 27.3,
    'smoking_status': 'formerly smoked'
}

prediction = predict_stroke(sample_data)
print("Stroke Risk:", prediction)
```

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

- 🌐 **Deploy as a web app** using Flask/Streamlit
- 🤖 **Add deep learning models** for better accuracy
- 🏥 **Integrate with real-world healthcare data**
- 💡 **Provide personalized health recommendations**
