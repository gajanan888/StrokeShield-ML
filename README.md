## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gajanan888/StrokeShield-ML.git
cd StrokeShield-ML
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebook inside `notebooks/` to explore training and evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is publicly available stroke prediction dataset (e.g., from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)).

* Attributes include age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, glucose levels, BMI, smoking status, etc.
* Target: **Stroke (Yes/No)**

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The project evaluates models based on:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
* ROC-AUC Curve

---

## 🧪 Example Usage

```python
from src.model import predict_stroke

sample_data = {
    'age': 55,
    'hypertension': 1,
    'heart_disease': 0,
    'avg_glucose_level': 105.5,
    'bmi': 27.3,
    'smoking_status': 'formerly smoked'
}

prediction = predict_stroke(sample_data)
print("Stroke Risk:", prediction)
```

---

## 🎯 Future Scope

* Deploy as a **web app** using Flask/Streamlit
* Add deep learning models for better accuracy
* Integrate with real-world healthcare data
* Provide personalized health recommendations
